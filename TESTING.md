* The website must contain a drop-down which lists four users.

* Selecting a user must display answers relevant to that user (see table below).

* The code written to calculate the answers to the questions must seem like it could handle different data if it were supplied, including the following edge-cases:

* User 4 has no data, so no questions apply to the user. Some intelligible statement should be shown to the user (e.g. "This user didn't listen to any songs.").

* If a question doesn't apply (e.g. if no songs were ever listened to on a Friday night), the interface should completely hide the question and answer. Displaying the question and an empty result, or any kind of error, is not acceptable.

* If fewer than three (but more than zero) genres were listened to the site should list the top genres listened to. It must not display text like "Top 3 genres", but may say "Top genres" or "Top 2 genres" or similar.

* Unit tests must be written for at least one non-trivial function.

* The website must score 100 for accessibility in Lighthouse

Bonus points (which don't mean anything):

* Re-using code between the "most often" questions (i.e. questions 1, 2, 3, 4).
* End-to-end tests.
